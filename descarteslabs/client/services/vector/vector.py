    Client for storing and querying vector data.

    The Descartes Labs Vector service allows you store vector features
    (points, polygons, etc.) with associated key-value properties, and
    query that data by geometry or by properties.

    It works best at the scale of millions of features. For small amounts
    of vector data that easily fit in memory, working directly with a GeoJSON
    file or similar may be more efficient.

    Concepts:

    * "Feature": a single geometric entity and its associated metadata
      (equivalent to a GeoJSON Feature).
    * "Product": a collection of related Features, with a common id,
      description, and access controls.

    This client currently returns data as dictionaries in

            Expression used to filter features by their properties, built from
            :class:`dl.properties <descarteslabs.common.property_filtering.filtering.GenericProperties>`.
            You can construct filter expression using the ``==``, ``!=``,
            ``<``, ``>``, ``<=`` and ``>=`` operators as well as the
            :meth:`~descarteslabs.common.property_filtering.filtering.Property.like`
            and :meth:`~descarteslabs.common.property_filtering.filtering.Property.in_`
            methods. You cannot use the boolean keywords ``and`` and ``or``
            because of Python language limitations; instead you can combine
            filter expressions with ``&`` (boolean "and") and ``|`` (boolean
            "or").
            Example (assuming ``from descarteslabs import properties as p``):
            ``query_expr=(p.temperature >= 50) & (p.hour_of_day > 18)``.
            More complex example:
            ``query_expr=(100 > p.temperature >= 50) | ((p.month
            != 10) & (p.day_of_month > 14))``.
            If you supply a property which doesn't exist as part of the
            expression that comparison will evaluate to ``False``.
