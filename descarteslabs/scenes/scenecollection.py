        `Scene.ndarray() <descarteslabs.scenes.scene.Scene.ndarray>` for details
        on data type conversions.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bands : str or Sequence[str]
            Band names to load. Can be a single string of band names
            separated by spaces (``"red green blue"``),
            or a sequence of band names (``["red", "green", "blue"]``).
            If the alpha band is requested, it must be last in the list
            to reduce rasterization errors.
        ctx : :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext`
            A :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext` to use when loading each Scene
        flatten : str, Sequence[str], callable, or Sequence[callable], default None
            "Flatten" groups of Scenes in the stack into a single layer by mosaicking
            each group (such as Scenes from the same day), then stacking the mosaics.

            ``flatten`` takes the same predicates as `Collection.groupby`, such as
            ``"properties.date"`` to mosaic Scenes acquired at the exact same timestamp,
            or ``["properties.date.year", "properties.date.month", "properties.date.day"]``
            to combine Scenes captured on the same day (but not necessarily the same time).

            This is especially useful when ``ctx`` straddles a scene boundary
            and contains one image captured right after another. Instead of having
            each as a separate layer in the stack, you might want them combined.

            Note that indicies in the returned ndarray will no longer correspond to
            indicies in this SceneCollection, since multiple Scenes may be combined into
            one layer in the stack. You can call ``groupby`` on this SceneCollection
            with the same parameters to iterate through groups of Scenes in equivalent
            order to the returned ndarray.

            Additionally, the order of scenes in the ndarray will change:
            they'll be sorted by the parameters to ``flatten``.
        mask_nodata : bool, default True
            Whether to mask out values in each band of each scene that equal
            that band's ``nodata`` sentinel value.
        mask_alpha : bool or str or None, default None
            Whether to mask pixels in all bands where the alpha band of all scenes is 0.
            Provide a string to use an alternate band name for masking.
            If the alpha band is available for all scenes in the collection and
            ``mask_alpha`` is None, ``mask_alpha`` is set to True. If not,
            mask_alpha is set to False.
        bands_axis : int, default 1
            Axis along which bands should be located.
            If 1, the array will have shape ``(scene, band, y, x)``, if -1,
            it will have shape ``(scene, y, x, band)``, etc.
            A bands_axis of 0 is currently unsupported.
        raster_info : bool, default False
            Whether to also return a list of dicts about the rasterization of
            each scene, including the coordinate system WKT
            and geotransform matrix.
            Generally only useful if you plan to upload data derived from this
            scene back to the Descartes catalog, or use it with GDAL.
        resampler : str, default "near"
            Algorithm used to interpolate pixel values when scaling and transforming
            each image to its new resolution or SRS. Possible values are
            ``near`` (nearest-neighbor), ``bilinear``, ``cubic``, ``cubicsplice``,
            ``lanczos``, ``average``, ``mode``, ``max``, ``min``, ``med``, ``q1``, ``q3``.
        processing_level : str, optional
            How the processing level of the underlying data should be adjusted. Possible
            values are ``toa`` (top of atmosphere) and ``surface``. For products that
            support it, ``surface`` applies Descartes Labs' general surface reflectance
            algorithm to the output.
        scaling : None, str, list, dict
            Band scaling specification. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        data_type : None, str
            Output data type. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        max_workers : int, default None
            Maximum number of threads to use to parallelize individual ndarray
            calls to each Scene.
            If None, it defaults to the number of processors on the machine,
            multiplied by 5.
            Note that unnecessary threads *won't* be created if ``max_workers``
            is greater than the number of Scenes in the SceneCollection.

        Returns
        -------
        arr : ndarray
            Returned array's shape is ``(scene, band, y, x)`` if bands_axis is 1,
            or ``(scene, y, x, band)`` if bands_axis is -1.
            If ``mask_nodata`` or ``mask_alpha`` is True, arr will be a masked array.
            The data type ("dtype") of the array is the most general of the data
            types among the scenes being rastered.
        raster_info : List[dict]
            If ``raster_info=True``, a list of raster information dicts for each scene
            is also returned

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If requested bands are unavailable, or band names are not given

        Parameters
        ----------
        bands : str or Sequence[str]
            Band names to load. Can be a single string of band names
            separated by spaces (``"red green blue"``),
            or a sequence of band names (``["red", "green", "blue"]``).
            If the alpha band is requested, it must be last in the list
            to reduce rasterization errors.
        ctx : :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext`
            A :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext` to use when loading each Scene
        mask_nodata : bool, default True
            Whether to mask out values in each band that equal
            that band's ``nodata`` sentinel value.
        mask_alpha : bool or str or None, default None
            Whether to mask pixels in all bands where the alpha band of all scenes is 0.
            Provide a string to use an alternate band name for masking.
            If the alpha band is available for all scenes in the collection and
            ``mask_alpha`` is None, ``mask_alpha`` is set to True. If not,
            mask_alpha is set to False.
        bands_axis : int, default 0
            Axis along which bands should be located in the returned array.
            If 0, the array will have shape ``(band, y, x)``,
            if -1, it will have shape ``(y, x, band)``.

            It's usually easier to work with bands as the outermost axis,
            but when working with large arrays, or with many arrays concatenated
            together, NumPy operations aggregating each xy point across bands
            can be slightly faster with bands as the innermost axis.
        raster_info : bool, default False
            Whether to also return a dict of information about the rasterization
            of the scenes, including the coordinate system WKT and geotransform matrix.
            Generally only useful if you plan to upload data derived
            from this scene back to the Descartes catalog, or use it with GDAL.
        resampler : str, default "near"
            Algorithm used to interpolate pixel values when scaling and transforming
            the image to its new resolution or SRS. Possible values are
            ``near`` (nearest-neighbor), ``bilinear``, ``cubic``, ``cubicsplice``,
            ``lanczos``, ``average``, ``mode``, ``max``, ``min``, ``med``, ``q1``, ``q3``.
        processing_level : str, optional
            How the processing level of the underlying data should be adjusted. Possible
            values are ``toa`` (top of atmosphere) and ``surface``. For products that
            support it, ``surface`` applies Descartes Labs' general surface reflectance
            algorithm to the output.
        scaling : None, str, list, dict
            Band scaling specification. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        data_type : None, str
            Output data type. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.


        Returns
        -------
        arr : ndarray
            Returned array's shape will be ``(band, y, x)`` if ``bands_axis``
            is 0, and ``(y, x, band)`` if ``bands_axis`` is -1.

        Download scenes as image files in parallel.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bands : str or Sequence[str]
            Band names to load. Can be a single string of band names
            separated by spaces (``"red green blue"``),
            or a sequence of band names (``["red", "green", "blue"]``).
        ctx : :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext`
            A :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext` to use when loading each Scene
        dest : str, path-like, or sequence of str or path-like
            Directory or sequence of paths to which to write the image files.

            If a directory, files within it will be named by
            their scene IDs and the bands requested, like
            ``"sentinel-2:L1C:2018-08-10_10TGK_68_S2A_v1-red-green-blue.tif"``.

            If a sequence of paths of the same length as the SceneCollection is given,
            each Scene will be written to the corresponding path. This lets you use your
            own naming scheme, or even write images to multiple directories.

            Any intermediate paths are created if they do not exist,
            for both a single directory and a sequence of paths.
        format : str, default "tif"
            Only if a single directory is given as ``dest``:
            what image format to use. One of "tif", "png", or "jpg".

            If ``dest`` is a sequence of paths, ``format`` is ignored
            and determined by the extension on each path.
        resampler : str, default "near"
            Algorithm used to interpolate pixel values when scaling and transforming
            the image to its new resolution or SRS. Possible values are
            ``near`` (nearest-neighbor), ``bilinear``, ``cubic``, ``cubicsplice``,
            ``lanczos``, ``average``, ``mode``, ``max``, ``min``, ``med``, ``q1``, ``q3``.
        processing_level : str, optional
            How the processing level of the underlying data should be adjusted. Possible
            values are ``toa`` (top of atmosphere) and ``surface``. For products that
            support it, ``surface`` applies Descartes Labs' general surface reflectance
            algorithm to the output.
        scaling : None, str, list, dict
            Band scaling specification. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        data_type : None, str
            Output data type. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        max_workers : int, default None
            Maximum number of threads to use to parallelize individual ``download``
            calls to each Scene.
            If None, it defaults to the number of processors on the machine,
            multiplied by 5.
            Note that unnecessary threads *won't* be created if ``max_workers``
            is greater than the number of Scenes in the SceneCollection.

        Returns
        -------
        paths : Sequence[str]
            A list of all the paths where files were written.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bands : str or Sequence[str]
            Band names to load. Can be a single string of band names
            separated by spaces (``"red green blue"``),
            or a sequence of band names (``["red", "green", "blue"]``).
        ctx : :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext`
            A :class:`~descarteslabs.scenes.geocontext.GeoContext` to use when loading the Scenes
        dest : str, path-like object, or file-like object, default None
            Where to write the image file.

            * If None (default), it's written to an image file of the given ``format``
              in the current directory, named by the requested bands,
              like ``"mosaic-red-green-blue.tif"``
            * If a string or path-like object, it's written to that path.

              Any file already existing at that path will be overwritten.

              Any intermediate directories will be created if they don't exist.

              Note that path-like objects (such as pathlib.Path) are only supported
              in Python 3.6 or later.
            * If a file-like object, it's written into that file.
        format : str, default "tif"
            If a file-like object or None is given as ``dest``: one of "tif", "png", or "jpg".

            If a str or path-like object is given as ``dest``, ``format`` is ignored
            and determined from the extension on the path (one of ".tif", ".png", or ".jpg").
        resampler : str, default "near"
            Algorithm used to interpolate pixel values when scaling and transforming
            the image to its new resolution or SRS. Possible values are
            ``near`` (nearest-neighbor), ``bilinear``, ``cubic``, ``cubicsplice``,
            ``lanczos``, ``average``, ``mode``, ``max``, ``min``, ``med``, ``q1``, ``q3``.
        processing_level : str, optional
            How the processing level of the underlying data should be adjusted. Possible
            values are ``toa`` (top of atmosphere) and ``surface``. For products that
            support it, ``surface`` applies Descartes Labs' general surface reflectance
            algorithm to the output.
        scaling : None, str, list, dict
            Band scaling specification. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        data_type : None, str
            Output data type. Please see :meth:`scaling_parameters` for a full
            description of this parameter.
        mask_alpha : bool or str or None, default None
            Whether to mask pixels in all bands where the alpha band of all scenes is 0.
            Provide a string to use an alternate band name for masking.
            If the alpha band is available for all scenes in the collection and
            ``mask_alpha`` is None, ``mask_alpha`` is set to True. If not,
            mask_alpha is set to False.

        Returns
        -------
        path : str or None
            If ``dest`` is a path or None, the path where the image file was written is returned.
            If ``dest`` is file-like, nothing is returned.

        will be interpreted. It would not usually be used in a normal
        workflow.

        A scene collection may contain scenes from more than one product,
        introducing the possibility that the band properties for a band
        of a given name may differ from product to product. This method
        works in a similar fashion to the
        :meth:`Scene.scaling_parameters <descarteslabs.scenes.scene.Scene.scaling_parameters>`
        method, but it additionally ensures that the resulting scale
        elements are compatible across the multiple products. If there
        is an incompatibility, an appropriate ValueError will be raised.

        Parameters
        ----------
        bands : list(str)
            List of bands to be scaled.
        scaling : None or str or list or dict
            Band scaling specification. See
            :meth:`Scene.scaling_parameters <descarteslabs.scenes.scene.Scene.scaling_parameters>`
            for a full description of this parameter.
        data_type : None or str
            Result data type desired, as a standard data type string (e.g.
            ``"Byte"``, ``"Uint16"``, or ``"Float64"``). If not specified,
            will be deduced from the ``scaling`` specification. See
            :meth:`Scene.scaling_parameters <descarteslabs.scenes.scene.Scene.scaling_parameters>`
            for a full description of this parameter.

        Returns
        -------
        scales : list(tuple)
            The fully specified scaling parameter, compatible with the
            :class:`~descarteslabs.client.services.raster.Raster` API and the
            output data type.
        data_type : str
            The result data type as a standard GDAL type string.

        Raises
        ------
        ValueError
            If any invalid or incompatible value is passed to any of the
            three parameters.

        the ``scaling`` and ``data_type`` parameters.
