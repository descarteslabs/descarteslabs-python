    assigns those privileges to everyone in that organization.

        Parameters
        ----------
        geometry: GeoJSON-like dict, object with ``__geo_interface__``; optional
            Include features intersecting this geometry. If this
            ``FeatureCollection`` is already filtered by a geometry,
            the new geometry will override it -- they cannot be chained.
        properties : ~descarteslabs.common.property_filtering.filtering.Expression; optional
            Expression used to filter features by their properties, built from
            :class:`dl.properties <descarteslabs.common.property_filtering.filtering.Properties>`.
            You can construct filter expression using the ``==``, ``!=``,

            methods. You cannot use the boolean keywords ``and`` and ``or``
            because of Python language limitations; instead you can combine
            filter expressions with ``&`` (boolean "and") and ``|`` (boolean
            "or").
            Example (assuming ``from descarteslabs import properties as p``):
            ``query_expr=(p.temperature >= 50) & (p.hour_of_day > 18)``.
            More complex example:
            ``query_expr=(100 > p.temperature >= 50) | ((p.month
            != 10) & (p.day_of_month > 14))``.
            If you supply a property which doesn't exist as part of the
            expression that comparison will evaluate to ``False``.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`FeatureCollection`

        Apply a filter to a product and delete features that match the filter criteria,
        taking into account calls to :meth:`filter`.  Cannot be used with
        calls to :meth:`limit`

        A query of some sort must be set, otherwise a ``BadRequestError`` will be raised.

        Delete jobs occur asynchronously and can take a long time to complete. You
        can access :meth:`features` while a delete job is running,
        but you cannot issue another :meth:`delete_features` until
        the current job has completed running.  Use
        :meth:`DeleteJob.wait_for_completion() <descarteslabs.vectors.async_job.DeleteJob.wait_for_completion>`
        to block until the job is done.

        Returns
        -------
        :class:`DeleteJob <descarteslabs.vectors.async_job.DeleteJob>`
            A new `DeleteJob`.

        Raises
        ------
        ~descarteslabs.exceptions.BadRequestError
            Raised when the request is malformed, e.g. the query limit is not a number.
        ~descarteslabs.vectors.exceptions.InvalidQueryException
            Raised when a limit was applied to the ``FeatureCollection``.
        ~descarteslabs.exceptions.NotFoundError
            Raised if the product cannot be found.
        ~descarteslabs.exceptions.RateLimitError
            Raised when too many requests have been made within a given time period.
        ~descarteslabs.exceptions.ServerError
            Raised when a unknown error occurred on the server.
