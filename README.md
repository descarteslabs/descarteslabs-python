### Added

### Changed

## [0.28.1] - 2019-12-10
### Changed
- Update workflows client channel
- Workflows map UI is more stable: errors and layers won't fill the screen

## [0.28.0] - 2019-12-09
### Added
- Catalog client: Added an `update()` method that allows you to update multiple attributes at once.

### Changed
- Catalog client: Images and Bands no longer reload the Product after calling `save`
- Catalog client: Various attributes that are lists now correctly track changes when modifying them with list methods (e.g. `Product.owners.append("foo")`)
- Catalog client: Error messages generated by the server have a nicer format
- Catalog client: Fix a bug that caused waiting for tasks to never complete
- The minimum `numpy` version has been bumped to 1.17.14 for Python version > 3.5, which addresses a bug with `scenes.display`

### Workflows (channel `v0-10`) - Added
- `.compute()` is noticeably faster
- Most of the Python string API is now available on `workflows.Str`
- Interactive map: more descriptive error when not logged in to iam.descarteslabs.com
- Passing the wrong types into functions causes more descriptive and reliable errors

### Workflows - Fixed
- `RST_STREAM` errors when calling `.compute()` have been eliminated
- `Image/ImageCollection.count()` is much faster
- `.buffer()` on vector types now works correctly
- Calling `.compute()` on a `GeometryCollection` works

## [0.27.0] - 2019-11-18
### Added

- Catalog client: Added a `MaskBand.is_alpha` attribute to declare alpha channel behavior for a band.

### Changed

- The maximum number of `extra_properties` allowed for Catalog objects has been increased from 10 to 50.
- Fixed bug causing `SceneCollection.download` to fail.

### Workflows (channel `v0-9`) - Added
- When you call `.compute()` on an `Image` or `ImageCollection`, the `GeoContext` is included on the result object (`ImageResult.geocontext`, `ImageCollectionResult.geocontext`)

### Workflows - Fixed
- Passing a Workflows `Timedelta` object (instead of a `datetime.timedelta`) into functions expecting it now behaves correctly
- Arguments to the reducer function for `reduce` are now in the correct order

## [0.26.0] - 2019-10-30
### Added

- A new catalog client in `descarteslabs.catalog` makes searching and managing products, bands and images easier. This client encompasses functionality previously split between the `descarteslabs.Metadata` and `descarteslabs.Catalog` client, which are now deprecated. Learn how to use the new API in the [Catalog guide](https://docs.descarteslabs.com/guides/catalog_v2.html).
- Property filtering expressions such as used in `scenes.search()` and `FeatureCollection.filter()` now support an `in_()` method.

### Changed

- `SceneCollection.download` previously always returned successfully even if one or more of the downloads failed. Now if any of the downloads fail, a RuntimeError is raised, which will detail which destination files failed and why.
- Fixed a bug where geometries used with the Scenes client had coordinates with reduced precision.

### Workflows (channel `v0-8`) - Added
- **Interactive parameters**: add parameters to map layers and interactively control them using widgets
- **Spatial convolution** with `wf.conv2d`
- Result containers have helpful `repr`s when displayed
- `Datetime` and `Timedelta` are unpacked into `datetime.datetime` and `datetime.timedelta` objects when computed.

### Workflows - Changed
- **[breaking]** Result containers moved to `descarteslabs/workflows/results` and renamed, appending "Result" to disambiguate (e.g. ImageResult and ImageCollectionResult)
- **[breaking] `.bands` and `.images` attributes of ImageResult and ImageCollectionResult renamed `.ndarray`**
- **[breaking]** When `compute`-ing an `Image` or `ImageCollection`, **the order of `bandinfo` is only correct for Python >= 3.6**
- Interactive maps: coordinates are displayed in lat, lon order instead of lon, lat for easier copy-pasting
- Interactive maps: each layer now has an associated output that is populated when running autoscale and deleted when the layer is removed
- Interactive maps: `Image.visualize` returns a `Layer` object, making it easier to adjust `Layer.parameters` or integrate with other widgets

### Workflows - Fixed
- Composing operations onto imported Workflows no longer causes nondeterministic errors when computed
- Interactive maps: `remove_layer` doesn't cause an error
- No more errors when creating a `wf.parameter` for `Datetime` and other complex types
- `.where` no longer causes a backend error
- Calling `wf.map.geocontext()` when the map is not fully initialized raises an informative error
- Operations on numbers computed from raster data (like `img_collection.mean(axis=None)`) no longer fail when computed
- Colormap succeeds when the Image contains only 1 value

## [0.25.0] - 2019-08-22
### Added

### Changed
- `Raster.stack` `max_workers` is limited to 25 workers, and will raise a warning and set the value to 25 if a value more than 25 is specified.

### Workflows (channel `v0-7`) - Added
- Interactive maps: `clear_layers` and `remove_layer` methods
- ImageCollections: `reversed` operator
- ImageCollections: `concat` and `sorted` methods
- ImageCollections: `head`, `tail`, and `partition` methods for slicing
- ImageCollections: `where` method for filtering by condition
- ImageCollections `map_window` method for applying sliding windows
- ImageCollections: Indexing into ImageCollections is supported (`imgs[1]`)
- **[breaking]** Statistics functions are now applied to named axes
- DateTime, Timedelta, Geocontext, Bool, and Geometry are now computable
- ImageCollectionGroupby ProxyObject for grouping ImageCollection by properties, and applying functions over groups
- ImageCollections: `groupby` method
- `parameter` constructor

### Workflows - Changed
- Interactive maps: autoscaling is now done in the background
- Tiles requests can now include parameters
- `median` is noticeably faster
- `count` is no longer breaks colormaps
- `map`, `filter`, and `reduce` are 2x faster in the "PREPARING" stage
- Significantly better performance for functions that reference variables outside their scope, like
```
overall_comp = ndvi.mean(axis="images")
deltas = ndvi.map(lambda img: img - overall_comp)
```
- Full support for floor-division (`//`) between Datetimes and Timedeltas (`imgs.filter(lambda img: img.properties['date'] // wf.Timedelta(days=14)`)

### Workflows - Removed
- **[breaking]** `ImageCollection.one` (in favor of indexing)

## [0.24.0] - 2019-08-01
### Added
- `scenes.DLTile.assign(pad=...)` method added to ease creation of a tile in all ways indentical except for the padding.

### Changed
- The parameter `nbits` has been deprecated for catalog bands.

### Workflows (channel `v0-6`) - Added
- New interactive map, with GUI controls for multiple layers, scaling, and colormaps.
- Colormaps for single-band images.
- Map interface displays errors that occur while the backend is rendering images.
- ImageCollection compositing no longer changes band names (`red` does not become `red_mean`, for example).
- `.clip()` and `.scale()` methods for Image/ImageCollection.
- Support specifying raster resampler method.
- Support specifying raster processing level: `toa` (top-of-atmosphere) or `surface` [surface reflectance).
- No more tiles 400s for missing data; missing/masked pixels can optionally be filled with a checkerboard pattern.

### Workflows - Changed
- Workflows `Image.concat` renamed `Image.concat_bands`.
- Data are left in `data_range` values if `physical_range` is not set, instead of scaling to the range `0..1`.
- Selecting the same band name twice (`img.pick_bands("vv vv")`) properly raises an error.
- Reduced `DeprecationWarning`s in Python 3.7.

## [0.23.0] - 2019-07-12
### Added
- Alpha Workflows API client has been added. Access to the Workflows backend is restricted; contact [support](https://descarteslabs.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portals) for more information.
- Workflows support for Python 3 added in channel v0-5.

### Changed

## [0.22.0] - 2019-07-09
### Added
- Scenes API now supports band scaling and output type specification for rastering methods.
- Methods in the Metadata, Raster, and Vector service clients that accepted GeoJSON geometries now also accept Shapely geometries.

### Changed

## [0.21.0] - 2019-06-19
### Added
- Add support for user cython modules in tasks.

### Changed
- Tasks webhook methods no longer require a `group_id` if a webhook id is provided.
- `catalog_id` property on images is no longer supported by the API
- Fix `scenes.display` handling of single band masked arrays with scalar masks
- Fix problems with incomplete `UploadTask` instances returned by `vectors.FeatureCollection.list_uploads`

## [0.20.0] - 2019-06-04
### Added
- Metadata, Catalog, and Scenes now support a new `storage_state` property for managing image metadata and filtering search results. `storage_state="available"` is the default for new images and indicates that the raster data for that scene is available on the Descartes Labs platform. `storage_state="remote"` indicates that the raster data has not yet been processed and made available to client users.
- The following additional colormaps are now supported for bands – 'cool', 'coolwarm', 'hot', 'bwr', 'gist_earth', 'terrain'. Find more details about the colormaps [here](https://matplotlib.org/gallery/color/colormap_reference.html).
- `Scene.ndarray`, `SceneCollection.stack`, and `SceneCollection.mosaic` now support passing a string as the `mask_alpha` argument to allow users to specify an alternate band name to use for masking.
- Scenes now supports a new `save_image` function that allows a user to save a visualization given a filename and extension.
- Tasks now allows you to unambiguously get a function by group id using `get_function_by_id`.
- All Client APIs now accept a `retries` argument to override the default retry configuration. The default remains
the same as the prior behavior, which is to attempt 3 retries on errors which can be retried.

### Changed
- Bands of different but compatible types can now be rastered together in `Scene.ndarray()` and `Scene.download()` as well as across multiple scenes in `SceneCollection.mosaic()`, `SceneCollection.stack()` and `SceneCollection.download()`. The result will have the most general data type.
- Vector client functions that accept a `geometry` argument now support passing Shapely shapes in addition to GeoJSON.

### Fixed

## [0.19.0] - 2019-05-06
### Changed
- Removed deprecated method `Metadata.sources()`
- `FeatureCollection.filter(geometry)` will now raise an `InvalidQueryException` if you
  try to overwrite an existing geometry in the filter chain.  You can only set the
  geometry once.

### Fixed

## [0.18.0] - 2019-04-18
### Changed
- Many old and obsolete examples were removed from the package.
- `Scene.ndarray`, `SceneCollection.stack`, and `SceneCollection.mosaic` now will automatically mask alpha if the alpha band is available in the relevant scene(s), and will set `mask_alpha` to `False` if the alpha band does not exist.
- `FeatureCollection.add`, `FeatureCollection.upload`, `Vector.create_feature`, `Vector.create_features`, and `Vector.upload_features` all accept a `fix_geometry` string argument that determines how to handle certain problem geometries
including those which do not follow counter-clockwise winding order (which is required by the GeoJSON spec but not many
popular tools). Allowed values are ``reject`` (reject invalid geometries with an error), ``fix`` (correct invalid
geometries if possible and use this corrected value when creating the feature), and ``accept`` (the default) which will
correct the geometry for internal use but retain the original geometry in the results.
- `Vector.get_upload_results` and `Vector.get_upload_result` now accept a `pending` parameter to include pending uploads
in the results. Such pending results will have `status: PENDING` and, in lieu of a task id, the `id` attribute will contain
the upload id as returned by `Vector.upload_features`
- `UploadTask.status` no longer blocks until the upload task is completed, but rather returns the current status of the
upload job, which may be `PENDING`, `RUNNING`, `SUCCESS`, or `FAILURE`.
- The `FutureTask.ready` and `UploadTask.ready` property has been added to test whether the task has completed.
A return value of `True` means that if `get_result(wait=True)` were to be called, it would return without blocking.
- You can now export features to a storage `data` blob.  To export from the
`vector` client, use `Vector.export_product_from_query()` with a storage key
and an optional query.  This returns the task id of the export task.  You
can ask for status using `Vector.get_export_results()` for all export tasks
or `Vector.get_export_result()` for a specific task by task id.
- FeatureCollection has been extended with this functionality with a
`FeatureCollection.export()` method that takes a storage key.  This operates
on the filter chain that FeatureCollection represents, or the full product
if there is no filter chain.  It returns an `ExportTask` which behaves
similar to the `FutureTask`.
- `Catalog.upload_image()` and `Catalog.upload_ndarray()` now will return an `upload_id` that can be used to query the status of that upload using `Catalog.upload_result()`.  Note that the upload id is the image id and if you use identical image ids `Catalog.upload_result()` will only show the result of the most recent upload.

### Fixed
- Several typical kinds of non-conforming GeoJSON which previously caused errors can now be accepted or
fixed by the `FeatureCollection` and `Vector` methods for adding or uploading new vector geometries.

## [0.17.3] - 2019-03-06
### Changed
- Fixed issues with `Catalog.upload_ndarray()` under Windows
- Added header to client requests to better debug retries

### Fixed
- Improved error messages for Catalog client upload methods

## [0.17.2] - 2019-02-26
### Changed
- Tasks methods `create_function`, `create_or_get_function`, and `new_group` now have image as a required parameter
- The `name` parameter is renamed to `product_id` in `Vector.create_product`, and `FeatureCollection.create` and `FeatureCollection.copy`.  The 'name' parameter is renamed to `new_product_id` in `Vector.create_product_from_query`.  Using `name` will continue to work, but will be removed completely in future versions.
- The `name` parameter is no longer required, and is ignored for `Vector.replace_product`, `Vector.update_product`, `FeatureCollection.update` and `FeatureCollection.replace`.  This parameter will be removed completely in future versions.

### Added
- `Metadata.paged_search` has been added and essentially supports the original behavior of `Metadata.search` prior to release 0.16.0.
This method should generally be avoided in favor of `Metadata.features` (or `Metadata.search`).

## [0.17.1] - 2019-02-11
### Added

### Changed
- Fixed typo in `UploadTask.status` which caused exception when handling certain failure conditions
- `FeatureCollection.upload` parameter `max_errors` was not being passed to Vector client.
- Ensure `cloudpickle==0.4.0` is version used when creating `Tasks`.
- Eliminate redundant queries from `FeatureCollection.list`.

## [0.17.0] - 2019-02-07
### Added
- `FeatureCollection.upload` and `Vector.upload_features` now accept an optional `max_errors` parameter to control how many errors are acceptable before declaring an upload a failure.
- `UploadTask` (as returned by `FeatureCollection.upload` and `Vector.list_uploads`) now has added attributes to better identify what was processed and what errors occurred.
- `Storage` now has added methods `set_file` and `get_file` to allow for better uploading and downloading, respectively, of large files.
- `Storage` class now has an `exists()` method that checks whether an object exists in storage at the location of a given `key` and returns a boolean.
- `Scenes.search` allows `limit=None`
- `FeatureCollection.delete_features` added to support deleting `Feature`s that match a `filter`
- `FeatureCollection.delete_features` and `FeatureCollection.wait_for_copy` now use `AsyncJob` to poll for asynchronous job completion.
- `Vector.delete_features_from_query` and `Vector.get_delete_features_status` added to support new `FeatureCollection` and `AsyncJob` methods.

### Changed
- Fixed tasks bugs when including modules with relative paths in `sys.path`

## [0.16.0] - 2019-01-28
### Added
- Tasks now support passing modules, data and requirements along with the function code, allowing for a more complex and customized execution environment.
- Vector search query results now report their total number of results by means of the standard `len()` function.

### Changed
- `Metadata.search` no longer has a 10,000-item limit, and the number of items returned will be closer to `limit`. This
method no longer accepts the `continuation_token` parameter.

## [0.15.0] - 2019-01-09
### Added
- Raster client can now handle arbitrarily large numbers of tiles generated from a shape using the new `iter_dltiles_from_shape()` method which allows you to iterate over large numbers of tiles in a time- and memory-efficient manner. Similarly the existing `dltiles_from_shape()` method can now handle arbitrarily large numbers of tiles although it can be very slow.
- Vector client `upload_features()` can now upload contents of a stream (e.g. `io.IOBase` derivative such as `io.StringIO`) as well as the contents of a named file.
- Vector FeatureCollection `add()` method can now handle an arbitrary number of Features. Use of the `upload_features()` method is still encouraged for large collections.
- Vector client now supports creating a new product from the results of a query against an existing product with the `create_product_from_query()` method. This support is also accessible via the new `FeatureCollection.copy()` method.
- XYZTile GeoContext class, helpful for rendering to web maps that use XYZ-style tiles in a spherical Mercator CRS.

### Changed
- Tasks client FutureTask now instantiates a client if none provided (the default).
- Catalog client methods now properly handle `add_namespace` parameter.
- Vector Feature now includes valid geojson type 'Feature'.
- Tasks client now raises new GroupTerminalException if a task group stops accepting tasks.
- General documentation fixes.

## [0.14.1] - 2018-11-26
### Added
- Scenes and raster clients have a `processing_level` parameter that can be used to turn on surface reflectance processing for products that support it

## [0.14.0] - 2018-11-07
### Changed
- `scenes.GeoContext`: better defaults and `bounds_crs` parameter
  - `bounds` are no longer limited to WGS84, but can be expressed in any `bounds_crs`
  - New `Scene.default_ctx` uses a Scene's `geotrans` to more accurately determine a `GeoContext` that will result in no warping of the original data, better handling sinusoidal and other non-rectilinear coordinate reference systems.
  - **Important:** the default GeoContexts will now return differently-sized rasters than before!
    They will now be more accurate to the original, unwarped data, but if you were relying on the old defaults, you should now explicitly set the `bounds` to `geometry.bounds`,
    `bounds_crs` to `"EPSG:4326"`, and `align_pixels` to True.
- `Scene.coverage` and `SceneCollection.filter_coverage` accept any geometry-like object, not just a `GeoContext`.

## [0.13.2] - 2018-11-06
### Changed
- `FutureTask` inheritance changed from `dict` to `object`.

### Added
- Can now specify a GPU parameter for tasks.
- `Vectors.upload` allows you to upload a JSON newline delimited file.
- `Vectors.list_uploads` allows you to list all uploads for a vector product.
- `UploadTask` contains the information about an upload and is returned by both methods.

## [0.13.1] - 2018-10-16
### Changed
- `Vector.list_products` and `Vector.search_features` get `query_limit` and `page_size` parameters.

### Fixed
- `Vector.upload_features` handles new response format.

### Added
- Vector client support for retrieving status information about upload jobs. Added methods `Vector.get_upload_results` and `Vector.get_upload_result`.

## [0.13.0] - 2018-10-05
### Changed
- Shapely is now a full requirement of this package. Note: Windows users should visit https://docs.descarteslabs.com/installation.html#windows-users for installation guidance.
- Reduced the number of retries for some failure types.
- Resolved intermittent `SceneCollection.stack` bug that manifested as `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'coords'` due to Shapely thread-unsafety.
- Tracking system environment to improve installation and support of different systems.

### Added
