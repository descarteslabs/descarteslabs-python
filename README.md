Descarteslabs
=============

Services
--------

This package includes service wrappers for Descartes Labs application services that 
do require additional dependencies (included in `requirements.txt`) and are thus not 
implicitly included in the root package (see above). Service wrappers include, 
primarily, Raster (image access), Metadata (image metadata) and Places (named
shapes and statistics).  These services are authenticated and in order to setup
authentication there is a convenience script to help you log in.

```bash
$ python setup.py install
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
$ descarteslabs auth login
```

For non-interactive environments, one needs to set the `CLIENT_ID` and `CLIENT_SECRET` 
environment variables. These can be retrieved from the `~/.descarteslabs/token_info.json`
created from the login process or generated fresh through [IAM](https://iam.descarteslabs.com).

```bash
$ export CLIENT_ID=...
$ export CLIENT_SECRET=...
```

The documentation for the latest release can be found at [https://docs.descarteslabs.com](https://docs.descarteslabs.com)

FAQ
---

If you are on older versions of Python 2.7, you may encounter warnings about
SSL such as:

  InsecurePlatformWarning: A true SSLContext object is not
  available. This prevents urllib3 from configuring SSL appropriately and 
  may cause certain SSL connections to fail. For more information, see 
  https://urllib3.readthedocs.org/en/latest  
  /security.html#insecureplatformwarning.

Please follow the instructions from
[stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/29099404/ssl-insecureplatform-error-when-using-requests-package)
and install the `"requests[security]"` package with, e.g. `pip install
"requests[security]"`.
